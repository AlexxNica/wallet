Firefly Wallet
==============

Coming soon. We are putting this repository up now so you can more
easily use the GitHub **watch** feature to get notified when there
are changes.


This repository will soon contain (in order of release):

- Initial 3D printable case; this is done and just needs to be uploaded
- Wiring diagram for the Firefly on a Breadboard or general routing
- Source code for Arduino for the hardware wallet
- Better 3D printed case; still being designed, but easier to wire
- Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout for more advanced, but tinier devices
